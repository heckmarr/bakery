To install `go get gitlab.com/localtoast/bakery`

Make sure to get all the dependencies as well, such as gocv and disintegration/
imaging

These are various toys I've built using the gitlab.com/localtoast/flourPower
repository. Ascii cameras, text editors, fun stuff. Currently ARR because you 
never know what idea I'm going to have pop out of this. Occasionally when a
function reaches maturity, I'll fork it and license it. For now, have fun!
